* built a 3d simple sound visualization in Unity using FFT from a tutorial
* built a 2d simple sound visualization in p5 using FFT inspired in [Malevich](https://dg19s6hp6ufoh.cloudfront.net/pictures/612954234/large/photo.jpeg?1458324892) in order to explore aesthetics

* when using an FFT in a small quantity of freq bands all the information is comprised by average. this makes bands behave similarly each other.
* I think FFT is not a great way to extract perceptual information from music, because our brain doesn't think in freq in order to isolate elements, but to put them in context

further steps
* learn about synesthesia
* research other ways of perceive music through shapes and color
  * I personally relate yellow and green with mellow frequencies as well as red with high pitches
* research which colors are more related to frequency bands
* research techniques to analyze music apart from FFT
